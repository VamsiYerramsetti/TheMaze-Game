# TheMaze-Game
A treasure hunt game I built with few of my classmates in grade 10

This was my first coding project desighned on the unity platform using C#.
The player controls the ball and his/her/their aim is to collect all the seven treasures without touching the maze wall.
If you are having trouble opening the .exe apllication brush through the project report and instruction manual/
Have Fun and good luck!
